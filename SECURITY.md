# Security Policy

GhostShift OS is a hobby operating system developed by volunteers. It is unreleased software still in early development, and so bugs and vulnerabilities can be safely disclosed publicly. If you find an issue, we would prefer if you report it as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ayu-haker/GhostShift-OS/issues/new). If your issue was found using a fuzzer, please check the issues first to see if it has already been recorded.
